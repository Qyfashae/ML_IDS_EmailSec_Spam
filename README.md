# ML_IDS_EmailSec_Spam
Intrusion Detection System that uses Machine Learning to detect Spam for SMTP for example company email server.

This Machine Learning script is some type of easy ML, but you can learn alot from it and also tweak as you want(and Need. CHECK THE CODE!)

For example you can use this for "vulnerability-code" bad-code. Make it train how XSS vulnerabilities occur or how IDOR vulnerabilities occur and so on.
